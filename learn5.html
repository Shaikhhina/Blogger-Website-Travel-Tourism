        <h1>BEST PLACES TO VISIT IN <span><br>Nepal</span> </h1>
        <p>Nepal: one of the most beautiful countries in Asia! With beautiful people, incredible nature and amazing<br> mountains! We travelled at a slow pace for a month through Nepal. Along the way, we visited busy Kathmandu,<br> hip and happening Pokhara and charming Bandipur. We also did a twelve-day hike in which we crossed the<br> highest walkable mountain pass in the world. With over 5416 meters high, the highest place we have ever been to!</p>

        <p>For many people, a multi-day hike through the Himalayas is the literal and figurative highlight of Nepal! If that also applies to you,<br> take into account extra rest days in your Nepal itinerary. Especially if you will be making altitude meters, you need acclimatization<br> time to get used to the altitude.</p>

It is a beautiful temple with an entire square built around it.<br> No matter how many temples you have seen, a visit to the Bouddhanath Stupa should not be missed during your trip. It has something<br>magical to walk around the stupa, (always walk clockwise), to see the many monks and to smell the incense.</p>
