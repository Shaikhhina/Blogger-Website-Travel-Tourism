        <h1>BEST PLACES TO VISIT IN<span><br>Sri Lanka</span> </h1>
        <p>Sri Lanka has countless beautiful beaches. In the east, you will find miles of empty sandy beach, and in the<br>south, there are many cute bays, interspersed with large rocks. Some coastal towns are perfect if you want to<br> (learn to) surf, other beaches are suitable for relaxing and other bays you have to visit for their nice hotspots<br> and restaurants. In this guide, I will tell you everything about the seven most beautiful beaches in Sri Lanka<br>and which beaches the best suit for your trip.</p>

        <h1>Trincomalee: miles of empty beaches in northeastern Sri Lanka</h1>
        <img src=" Images/img21.jpg" style="width:80%;height:400px">
            <p>Are you looking for really empty beaches where you can be alone with the waves and drink coconut just with yourself? <br>Then go to Nilaveli Beach. This four-kilometre long beach is still completely empty in many places. On the weekends you see the<br>  local children playing in the waves, during the week there is hardly anyone. Nilaveli Beach is nine kilometres away from Trincomalee.</p>
